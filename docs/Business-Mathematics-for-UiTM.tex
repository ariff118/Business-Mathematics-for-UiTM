\section{Classification of real numbers}\label{classification-of-real-numbers}}

The real number system began to be learned and used in the early stages of schooling. However the development of real numbers must be understood and used more carefully so that a mathematical sentence can be fully defined. The following is an explanation of the development of real numbers.

A number is a feature of a set that does not depend on the properties of the elements of that set. The intended feature is represented by set symbols

\[\{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \}\]

common in everyday use. The symbols were inherited from the Indians and introduced by the Arabs. Each symbol is given a digit or number name and any combination of those symbols is called a number. These numbers are known by their properties as follows shown in the table and figure illustration below.

\hypertarget{real-numbers}{%
\subsection{Real Numbers}\label{real-numbers}}

Real numbers denoted as \(R\) as in Figure \ref{fig:numbers} consist of all numbers that can be categorized as rational numbers (\(Q\)) and irrational numbers (\(I\)).

\hypertarget{rational-numbers}{%
\subsection{Rational Numbers}\label{rational-numbers}}

A rational numbers denoted as (\(Q\)) is defined as numbers that can be written in the form of a fraction \(\frac{a}{b}\) such that \(a\) and \(b\) are integers and \(b \ne 0\). Examples of rational numbers that takes the form of a fractions as define are \(\{ \frac{18}{5}, \frac{2}{3}, 5=\frac{5}{1} \}\) or even \(\{ \sqrt{9}=3=\frac{3}{1} \}\).

In addition, rational numbers can also takes the form of numbers that have terminating decimals or repeated digits. Among the examples are numbers such as \(\{ 2.75, 1.5, 0.8, 0.666666, 0.0238238\bar{238} \}\). The first three values in the previous example are considered to have a characteristics of a terminating decimals, while the last two numbers are examples of rational numbers with repeated digits.

\hypertarget{natural-numbers}{%
\subsection{Natural Numbers}\label{natural-numbers}}

A natural number is a number used to count most elements in a set. The notation of natural number representation is \(N\) with

\[N = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, ... \}\]

\section{Linear equations}\label{linear-equations}}

A linear algebra term is a term with a variable that has a power of 1. While a linear algebra expression is a combination of one or more linear terms connected by addition or subtraction operations or both. Therefore, a linear equation can be defined as an equation consisting of linear algebraic expressions or linear algebraic expressions and numbers.

\hypertarget{linear-equation-with-one-variable}{%
\subsection{Linear equation with one variable}\label{linear-equation-with-one-variable}}

As the name implies, namely \texttt{one-variable\ linear\ equation} is identified with the \texttt{=} sign (equal to) and contains \(1\) (one) unknown. Basically, a one-variable linear equation is an equation in the form of an open sentence that is connected by a \texttt{=} (equal to) sign and only contains or has \(1\) unknown.

Why is it said to be an open sentence? Because the basic concept of an open sentence is a sentence whose truth cannot be known, it could be true, it could be wrong. For example, \(x+4=9\), if \(x=5\) then, the sentence is \(true\), because it is true that \(5+4=9\), but if \(x=1\), then the sentence is \(false\), because \(1+4=5\), not \(9\).

Well, in general the form of a one-variable linear equation is

\[ax+b=0\]

where \(a\) = coefficient; \(b\) = constant; and \(x\) = variable.

Keep in mind that the variable used does not have to be a variable \(x\), \(x\) in the equation only represents or represents a variable, for example \(2y+5=0\), where the coefficient is \(2\), the variable is \(y\), and the constant is \(5\).

Try again with the linear equation \(4p–4=0\), then the coefficient is \(4\), the variable is \(p\), and the constant is \(-4\) (do not forget the minus, guys).

\section{Ratio}\label{ratio}}

In general, ratio is a way to relate or compare between two items or more. In this book, we will discuss the concept of ratio of two quantities and ratio of three quatities. An important note for consideration when dealing mathematical problems with ratio is to make sure that comparison is on quatities with the same unit of measurement.

\hypertarget{ratio-of-two-quantities}{%
\subsection{Ratio of two quantities}\label{ratio-of-two-quantities}}

Ratio of two quantities is a comparison between two quantities that have the same unit. The ratio of two quantities can be written in the form \(a:b\) or \(\frac{a}{b}\), provided that \(b \neq 0\) and \(a\) and \(b\) have the same unit.

\textbf{Example 1}\\
The ratio of money at hand for Zul and Jefri is \(3:5\). Zul has RM210.\\
(a) Calculate Jefri's money.\\
(b) Given that the ratio of money had by Zul to Mat is \(2:7\), calculate the sum of money that both Zul and Mat have.

\emph{Solution}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\alph{enumi})}
\tightlist

\end{enumerate}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ccc@{}}
\toprule
Zul & Jefri & Total \\
\midrule
\endhead
3 & 5 & 8 \\
210 & x & \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

We consider any two columns with one unknown; i.e., we choose column first two columns.

\[\frac{3}{210} =\ \frac{5}{x}\]
\[x =\ \frac{5}{3}(210)\]
\[x =\ RM350\]

~

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\alph{enumi})}

\toprule
Zul & Mat & Total \\
\midrule
\endhead
2 & 7 & 9 \\
210 & y & z \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Since the question asked for the sum of money, we have two options to solve the problem. First, by calculating the money that Mat have and sum with Zul's money; or, secondly, we can calculate the total directly.

To calculate the total directly, we used the first and third column.

\[\frac{2}{210}=\frac{9}{z}\]
\[z=\frac{9}{2}(210)\]
\[z=RM945\]

\begin{enumerate}
