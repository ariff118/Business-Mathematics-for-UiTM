In this book, we will discuss the concept of ratio of two quantities and ratio of three quatities. An important note for consideration when dealing mathematical problems with ratio is to make sure that comparison is on quatities with the same unit of measurement. 1.9.1 Ratio of two quantities Ratio of two quantities is a comparison between two quantities that have the same unit. The ratio of two quantities can be written in the form \\(a:b\\) or \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\), provided that \\(b \\neq 0\\) and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have the same unit. Example 1 The ratio of money at hand for Zul and Jefri is \\(3:5\\). Zul has RM210. (a) Calculate Jefri's money. (b) Given that the ratio of money had by Zul to Mat is \\(2:7\\), calculate the sum of money that both Zul and Mat have. Solution Zul Jefri Total 3 5 8 210 x We consider any two columns with one unknown; i.e., we choose column first two columns. \\[ \\frac{3}{210}=\\frac{5}{x} \\\\ x=\\frac{5}{3}(210) \\\\ x=RM350 \\] Zul Mat Total 2 7 9 210 y z Since the question asked for the sum of money, we have two options to solve the problem. First, by calculating the money that Mat have and sum with Zul's money; or, secondly, we can calculate the total directly. To calculate the total directly, we used the first and third column. \\[ \\frac{2}{210}=\\frac{9}{z} \\\\ z=\\frac{9}{2}(210) \\\\ z=RM945 \\] "],["simple-interest-and-bank-discount.html", "Chapter 2 Simple Interest and Bank Discount", " Chapter 2 Simple Interest and Bank Discount Insert contents here.
